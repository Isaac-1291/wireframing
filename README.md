## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes are blueprints that help designers visualize the structure of a webpage or application before development begins. The key elements found in a wireframe include:

### 1. Layout Structure
This refers to the arrangement of components on a screen — including headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.

**Example:**  
In a booking app, the layout might show a search bar at the top, listings in the middle, and filters on the left.

### 2. Navigation
Navigation outlines how users will move through the application — using links, menus, and buttons.

**Example:**  
A horizontal nav bar with links like "Home", "Bookings", "Favourites", and "Profile" helps users find key pages easily.

### 3. Content Placement
This defines where key pieces of content (text, images, and actions) are positioned.

**Example:**  
On a listing page, placing a large image above the price and description ensures the visual appeal catches the user's eye first.

### 4. Functionality
Wireframes may show functionality using notes, symbols, or labels — such as dropdowns, modals, or button actions.

**Example:**  
A “Book Now” button might be shown with a label indicating it opens a payment form.
