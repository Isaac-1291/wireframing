## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes are blueprints that help designers visualize the structure of a webpage or application before development begins. The key elements found in a wireframe include:

### 1. Layout Structure
This refers to the arrangement of components on a screen — including headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.

**Example:**  
In a booking app, the layout might show a search bar at the top, listings in the middle, and filters on the left.

### 2. Navigation
Navigation outlines how users will move through the application — using links, menus, and buttons.

**Example:**  
A horizontal nav bar with links like "Home", "Bookings", "Favourites", and "Profile" helps users find key pages easily.

### 3. Content Placement
This defines where key pieces of content (text, images, and actions) are positioned.

**Example:**  
On a listing page, placing a large image above the price and description ensures the visual appeal catches the user's eye first.

### 4. Functionality
Wireframes may show functionality using notes, symbols, or labels — such as dropdowns, modals, or button actions.

**Example:**  
A “Book Now” button might be shown with a label indicating it opens a payment form.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are visual representations of a user interface that focus on structure, layout, and functionality. They come in two main types: **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity**, depending on their level of detail and purpose.

### 🔹 Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes are simple and quick representations of layout ideas. They are often hand-drawn or made with basic shapes and are used early in the design process.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal detail
- Grayscale or black-and-white
- Placeholder content
- No interactivity or styling

**Used When:**
- Brainstorming ideas
- Collaborating quickly with teams
- Gathering early feedback

### 🔹 High-Fidelity Wireframes

High-fidelity wireframes are detailed and polished. They closely resemble the final design and often include real content, styling, colors, and UI elements.

**Characteristics:**
- Real images and text
- Fonts, color schemes, spacing
- Sometimes interactive or clickable
- Used for user testing or client presentations

**Used When:**
- Finalizing designs before development
- Communicating details to developers
- Running usability tests with users

## What Type of Wireframe is in the Figma Link?

**Figma Design Reference:**  
[Project Airbnb Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/E2BRqdPcKkrnX6hLGPto8Z/Project-Airbnb?node-id=1-2&p=f&t=Af7RabuOPxn1Xi2R-0)

### 🔎 Answer:
The wireframe shown in the Figma file is a **High-Fidelity Wireframe**.

### ✅ Reasoning:
- It includes actual UI components such as buttons, cards, text, and images
- The design uses defined spacing, colors, and fonts
- It appears interactive and aligned with brand presentation
- It is ready for development handoff or user testing

This makes it suitable for use in later stages of the design process.
